                    <p>A large, generic Indian drug manufacturer was under regulatory scrutiny for poor investigation and laboratory practices.  Consultants from QualiCeutics joined others to perform a retrospective review of past OOS investigations and chromatographic test results.</p>
                    <p>The OOS retrospective review of manufacturing and laboratory investigations was led by QualiCeutics, who managed multiple consultant resources.  The project was successfully delivered in less than 30 days and included over 200 formal retrospective reviews, along with a final summary report to the client.</p>

                    <p>QualiCeutics joined other consultants to help implement a site-wide Quality Improvement initiative for a European pharma client.  For this project, QualiCeutics was specifically brought in to formally assess the Data Integrity processes and practices related to all stand-alone computerized Lab Systems within the QC department.</p>
                    <p>Over a period of several months, practices related to the generation, modification, security, traceability, and storage of electronic records and signatures were reviewed for more than 25 instrument types.  Findings and recommendations for remediation, based on compliance with EU and US regulations, were detailed in a final report to the client.</p>

                    <p>A global manufacturer of sterile injectables operating under an FDA Warning Letter was in need of an upgrade to their antiquated LIMS system.  The client chose to upgrade to ThermoFisher’s latest SampleManager LIMS version. The initial phase of the project planning had been over simplified, suffering from minimal user requirements and process mapping.  The implementation was also complicated by the addition of new functional modules, including Environmental Monitoring.</p>
                    <p>The QualiCeutics Group was chosen to lead the second phase of the project.  Working with a team of Subject Matter Experts, QualiCeutics successfully re-built the project plan, re-focused the team and lead the project through the qualification phase.</p>

                    <p>As part of a larger remediation effort, QualiCeutics was chosen to lead a workstream tasked with re-engineering a Quality Control training program. The program had to support approximately 125 staff members, and no formal training material existed at the time.</p>
                    <p>A new curriculum was developed to support multiple roles and new processes  were implemented and integrated within the client’s local Learning Management Systems (LMS).  The effort included the creation of more than 30 QC training courses, with each course containing an instruction guide, a student guide and a skill assessment form.  Modules ranged from basic lab practices, such as  performing pH measurements, to more complex skills like chromatographic review techniques.  Responsibilities also included the delivery of classroom training sessions without impact to productivity, which QualiCeutics was able to deliver.</p>

                    <p>Health regulators expect drug manufacturers to consistently and predictably make medicine with a high degree of quality.

                    <p>Health inspectors continue to focus their attention on Data Integrity when auditing a manufacturing site.  Many companies are now facing large fines and bans on imports due to poor electronic data handling practices discovered by these inspectors. In some cases, recorded data has even been knowingly falsified.</p>
                    <p>In most cases, companies unintentionally put themselves at risk by continuing to rely on paper documentation while simultaneously generating electronic records. If you are at risk for failing this sort of audit, trust QualiCeutics – we know how to build robust practices around data integrity.</p>
                    <p>Manufacturers use many computerized systems to produce and test medicines, and the electronic records created by these systems must be controlled.  This is especially true in the QC Laboratory, where Chromatography Data Systems create thousands of files.  The processes used to manage these systems are more complicated than paper records and require a thorough understanding of the regulations.</p>
                    <p>You need to ask yourself the following questions regarding your control of computerized systems:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <p>Are there formal processes in place to control username and passwords or share administrative rights?</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Do user privileges prevent or track multiple changes to chromatographic test data? Are procedures in place to control chromatographic integration practices?</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Are sufficient audit trials in place?</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Is the data adequately backed up and maintained?</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Is all data traceable and available for an inspector to review, if required?</p>
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <p>Are instrument reports set up properly?</p>
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>We know the systems and processes required to assure each client creates, modifies, and maintains controlled data. It’s extremely important to be proactive when dealing with data integrity.</p>
                    <p>Contact QualiCeutics to perform a deep-dive assessment into your data handling practices.  Let us leave you confident that your electronic records are consistently authentic, traceable, and secure.</p>

                    <p>Any computer system used in the manufacturing or testing of pharmaceuticals must be validated or qualified. Custom programing or configuration settings must be proven to work. Computer System Validation (CSV) is a formal process used to verify that a computer and software application is installed, functions as intended and is controlled in a reproducible way.</p>
                    <p>QualiCeutics has successfully led or participated in the installation and validation of several types of complex enterprise systems used by Quality Assurance and Quality Control, including:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p>Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMPs) always include a training component, and companies seemingly meet this requirement. Unfortunately, most organizations do not have a robust or effective enough training program and practices are not typically harmonized at the site.  Many programs are informal and administered by staff who have not been routinely supported, resulting in training that offers little value.</p>
                    <p>At QualiCeutics, we believe a vigorous training program is the most effective way to build a culture of quality at your organization. We have experience designing effective training programs, including:</p>
