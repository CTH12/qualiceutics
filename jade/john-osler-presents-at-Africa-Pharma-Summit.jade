                  p  In its 3rd year, the Africa Pharmaceutical Summit (APS) has established itself as the most strategic industry event in Africa.  APS has quickly become the leading international summit and exhibition series for Africa’s fast growing pharmaceutical sector.  APS East is a 3-day event being held on February 23-25 of this year in Nairobi, Kenya. The APS brings together all major stakeholders from the region ranging from industry leaders, policy-makers, regulators, academics, investors, scientists and patient representatives.

                  p In December, the Qualiceutics Group announced it would sponsor the event. Over 1,000 participants are expected at the APS East conference.  Many topics will be covered during the event, which will include several panel sessions on Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs).

                  p John Osler, President and Senior Compliance Consultant at the QualiCeutics Group, will participate in the February 24, Day 1 Panel Session entitled, “Creating a Normative Base for the Full Introduction of GMP for the Local Pharma Industry.”  John plans on sharing consulting experiences and the lessons he has learned from past remediation efforts and compliance projects in an effort to proactively shape the quality and compliance culture in East Africa.

                  p Learn more about this panel the the schedule for Day 1 of the program here: #[a(href='http://africapharmasummit.com/programme/', target='_blank') www.africapharmasummit.com/programme ]
