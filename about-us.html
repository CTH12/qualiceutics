                                  <p>Kathleen Ransom is a Senior Compliance Consultant in the Pharmaceutical industry.</p>
                                  <p>Kathleen has worked in the Pharmaceutical industry for over 30 years in several roles; advancing from an analytical chemist in QC and R&amp;D to the QA Site Quality Head. Each position compounding upon the previous multiplied her expertise and knowledge in industry practice and regulatory compliance.</p>
                                  <p>In 2010, Kathleen transitioned into Pharmaceutical consulting to serve pharma clients in meeting regulatory agency commitments and requirements per cGMP for safe and effective medicines.  Kathleen specializes in cGMP Laboratory Compliance which includes OOS/OOT laboratory investigations, data integrity forensics, Compendia requirements and ICH Guidelines.</p>
                                  <p>As a consultant, Kathleen has worked both internationally and domestically for large and mid-sized pharmaceutical firms.  Her projects comprised independent work and leadership roles including, team lead for a laboratory remediation project, forensic data integrity analysis and site training on the FDA’s expected practices, and retrospective review of Out of Specification (OOS) Laboratory Investigations and Manufacturing Deviations.  Her expertise also includes resolving customer complaints and writing lab and manufacturing investigations.  Kathleen’s product line experience includes radiopharmaceuticals, APIs, solid dose, liquids, sterile injectables and OTC drugs.</p>
                                  <p>Kathleen’s corporate experience included leadership positions at TEVA Pharmaceuticals and KV Pharmaceuticals in the Quality Control and Quality Assurance departments.  Project management included successful implementation of LIMS, method validation and global method transfers at both companies.  Kathleen initiated and led the project, for over 250 APIs and excipients, to meet the new requirements for USP Chapter <467> Residual Solvents.  Kathleen also successfully led the laboratory remediation plan under a voluntary consent decree resulting from manufacturing deviations.  Each of Kathleen’s projects involved coordination with other departments including Regulatory, R&amp;D, Technical Services and Manufacturing.</p>
                                  <p>Kathleen’s passion throughout her career has always been to continually adopt challenging projects and technical process improvements.  This desire has served her well, and carries forward as she imparts her expertise to benefit her pharma clients.</p>
                                  <p>Kathleen holds a Master’s degree in Business and a BS degree in Chemistry from Missouri Baptist University.  She and her family are based in Missouri and enjoy a variety of outdoor activities and exploring new territories.</p>
